* Optimized application for low-bandwidth scenarios by providing an optional audio stream only toggle.

Please refer to the project report pdf file for detailed summary.

Features:

only those users to use our application.
* Dynamic Rooms – The rooms are created dynamically giving users the freedom
to name the rooms according to their choice.
